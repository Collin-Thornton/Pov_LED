# Pov_LED

Arduino code to create a simple rotating persitence of vision display. The program keeps track of the RPM of the display and adjusts the timing of the flashes based on experimentally determined data. Each character is predefined so that the user only has to enter the string to display. 

As of now, the message is fixed on the display and cannot be more than ten characters in length.
