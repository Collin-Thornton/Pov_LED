# Pov_LED

Arduino code to create a simple rotating persitence of vision display. Based on an established ratio, the program keeps track of the RPM of the display, and adjusts the timing of the flashes accordingly. Each character is predefined - which is what takes up the bulk of the program - so that the user only has to enter the string to display. 

As of now, the message is fixed on the display and cannot be more than ten characters in length.
